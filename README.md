# Frontend Mentor Solutions

Welcome to my repository for **Frontend Mentor** challenges! Here you'll find my solutions to various challenges I've completed on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) platform.

## About Frontend Mentor

Frontend Mentor offers developers realistic projects to help improve their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills through hands-on practice. The challenges range from small UI components to complex, multi-page web applications.

## Repository Structure

Each solution is organized into its own directory, named after the specific challenge. Inside each directory, you will typically find:

```
Challenge-name/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js (if applicable)
├── README.md (solution details)
└── assets/ (images, icons, etc.)
```
